# Linked Lists - Recursive Reverse

[URL](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e725b930957a038a000042)

Write a Recursive Reverse() function that recursively reverses a linked list. You may want to use a nested function for the recursive calls.

```python
var list = 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> null
reverse(list) === 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> null
```

Inspired by Stanford Professor Nick Parlante's excellent [Linked List teachings](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf).
